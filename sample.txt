Science is the pursuit of knowledge and understanding of the natural and social world. It relies on evidence and follows a systematic methodology based on observation, experimentation, and reasoning.

Atoms are the basic units of matter, consisting of protons, neutrons, and electrons. The periodic table organizes all known elements based on their atomic structure and properties.

Energy exists in many forms, including kinetic, potential, thermal, electrical, chemical, and nuclear. It cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.

Living organisms are made up of cells, which carry genetic material in the form of DNA. Evolution by natural selection explains the diversity of life on Earth.

Physics explores the laws that govern the universe, such as gravity, motion, and thermodynamics. Chemistry focuses on the composition, structure, and properties of substances.

Earth science includes the study of geology, meteorology, and oceanography. It helps us understand natural phenomena like earthquakes, weather patterns, and climate change.

Technology and scientific research go hand in hand. Innovations in fields like biotechnology, space exploration, and artificial intelligence are reshaping the future.

The scientific method involves asking questions, forming hypotheses, conducting experiments, and analyzing results. It is a key tool in solving real-world problems and advancing human knowledge.
